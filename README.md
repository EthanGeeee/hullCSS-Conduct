# Code of Conduct
All hullCSS members are subject to our Code of Conduct. This is not considered an exhaustive list, but any breach will be considered against this code.

- All hullCSS events are inclusive spaces. No homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make exclusionary jokes, even "ironically".
- Harassment will not be tolerated. Any physical contact or sexual attention without [enthusiastic consent](https://respectyourself.info/sex/consent/enthusiastic-consent/) is harassment, or even abuse. Clothing or flirting are not necessarily consent. If you're asked to stop, stop. If in doubt, ask the other person.
- Aggression and elitism are unwelcome - knowledge should be shared, it is not a competition.
- We may run events where alcohol is available. There is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol, or conversely not to drink alcohol. If you're overly intoxicated, or are causing major disruption, you will be asked to leave.
-  Weâ€™d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the person's preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them.
-  People's private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status.
- Do not take photos of others without their permission. They are entitled to their privacy.
- Choose your words carefully. This is a professional environment, you never know who's listening.
- Disagreements happen, understand why. Disagreements can and will arise, however this isn't an excuse to be offensive or intimidating. Debate is encouraged but keep it civil. Be open to new open to different points of view, you might learn something.
- Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Speech is free and there are no wrong questions, but keep it considerate and respect someone's right to refuse to answer.
- Discussion of how to improve the community or make it more inclusive are always welcome.


If you're concerned about someone's behaviour, please let us know in person or by emailing hullcss@hull.ac.uk. All reports are confidential!

## Consequences
### Warnings
It's always better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the code of conduct before it actually does so. As such, issue them a warning. Any warnings issued should be reported to the exec, or at hullcss@hull.ac.uk

### Asking people to leave
If we're running an event and need to remove you for the wellbeing of the community, we may ask you to leave.
This will be enforced using the University Security, or by the venue staff.

### Termination of Membership
In extreme cases we may feel it necessary to remove community members who are abusive or aggressive. This will be done through the official University channels, and in extreme cases may be reported to the police.
